# TaskToken 🚀

**TaskToken** is a decentralized task management smart contract that mints **soulbound fungible tokens** as a form of **reputation** for developers upon completing tasks. These tokens serve as a permanent, verifiable record of a developer’s contributions, tracked **on-chain** for transparency and accountability. 💪

## Features ✨

- **Task Management** 📋: Developers can submit and complete tasks.
- **Soulbound Tokens** 🪙: Upon task completion, developers receive soulbound fungible tokens as a form of reputation.
- **On-Chain Records** 📈: All tasks and associated reputation tokens are recorded on-chain for transparency.
- **Immutable Proof** 🔒: The earned tokens act as an immutable proof of work done, allowing developers to showcase their contributions.
- **Developer Incentives** 💼: By earning tokens, developers can build a reputation in the community, opening opportunities for future work.

## How It Works 🔧

1. **Task Creation** 📝: A task is created on the platform, specifying the details and requirements.
2. **Task Completion** ✅: Developers complete the task and submit their work for review.
3. **Token Minting** 🪙: Upon successful completion and approval, a **TaskToken** is minted for the developer, serving as proof of their work.
4. **Reputation Building** 🌟: Developers accumulate **TaskTokens** as they complete more tasks, establishing their reputation within the ecosystem.
